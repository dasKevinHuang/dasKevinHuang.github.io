####What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I've learned to become more comfortable with the different uses for padding, borders, and margins. In the previous challenges, I had also experimented at length the uses of each of these CSS properties. 

In this solo challenges, I was able to use border values especially to make create unique designs with border styles on my index pages. I found that border-radius was a very useful tool to render circle masks over images (such as my photo that I used on my index page).

Padding and margins were helpful in different situations for positioning elements, especially in relation to neighboring elements. Padding was very useful when it came to positioning groups of internal elements, while margins became more useful when dealing with other external elements.

####What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned that the more time I spend doing it and getting more experienced with CSS positioning directly, the more comfortable and familiar I am with doing it. Since this challenege is the last of many this week that related to CSS, I felt that I benefitted quite a lot from having practiced using CSS positioning values in the previous challenges.

I think I learned quite a bit on how to use padding, borders, and margins to change the box models of specific elements to suit the needs of my content structure. I also learned about the importance of position values (such as relative) and how they help with positioning precise element placements. It's interesting to note that strategically using multiple grouping elements to divide content is very useful to general CSS positioning and can make the process easier.

####What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I thought that working with fonts and links were the easiest to work with. Changing font sizes and styles was very simple compared to other design elements that needed to be implemented.

Positioning elements seemed to be the most tedious and difficult. It was due to the fact that my design, while simple, required some precise maneuvering of CSS on elements to obtain the correct structure. I overcame this by isolating the troubled element and also checking for conflicting CSS properties from other elements

####What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned that elements can be customized heavily with CSS! It was amazing to experiment and see all the things that CSS can do to make HTML look nice. I found that having a strong HTML structure to begin with was important to be able to utilize CSS to the fullest. Especially having thoughtful content divisions through the use of divs, spans, and even semantic elements benefits the use of CSS.

I thought that the ability to combine classes and override CSS properties of stylesheets makes for a lot of potential customization with the way CSS is written and is used. I really appreciated the ability to customize my blog stylesheet, while being able to inherit some specific CSS properties from my default stylesheet. This ability made it a lot easier to write the CSS for this challenge.
