     Hi there! My name is Kevin Huang. I'm a part of the Squirrels cohort at Dev Bootcamp. In this blog, you will find out about my weekly adventures with Dev Bootcamp and the topics that are being taught! For this blog post I will be introducing you to version control, git and Github - all very important things. Without further ado, let's dive in!
    </p>
    <p>
        First, let's find out what version control is. Version control allows you to track changes that happen to your files and review why, when, and how they happened. This is very important in development because if a random glitch were to be added into code that you wrote, you would want to know why, when, and how that happened. Version control software does all of that for you automatically!
    </p>
    <p>
       Now that we know what version control is, we can dive into version control software, specifically git! Git is a popular version control software that makes it easy for developers to work collaboratively while tracking ANY changes made to their code. With git, developers working together across the world can ensure that they are all working with the exact same file simultaneously. Even if they make changes to that same file, git allows those developers to precisely merge their changes so that all of the work can be unified. Without git doing this for them, developers might accidentally overwrite code that another developer's work. Git is installed locally on your computer and helps you track changes to your code by keeping a log of actions. Any number of actions performed in git can be reversed, so if any mistakes are made, don't worry - you can always undo changes that are made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, let's find out what GitHub is and why it matters. GitHub is a service that allows your to host and share code on their remote servers, which use git for version control. Because GitHub hosts your folders using git, it's easy to share code and work collaboratively with other developers using its services. GitHub works remotely and automatically tracks any changes with git. GitHub is important because it acts as a social network for development by making it easy to share and work on code in collaboratively on the Internet.
